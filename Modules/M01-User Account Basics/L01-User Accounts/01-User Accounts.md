<h2>User Accounts</h2>
<p>In  (AD DS), all users who require access to network resources must have a <em>user</em> <em>account</em>. A user account is an AD DS object that contains all the information that's required to authenticate and authorize the user during the sign-in process and build the user's access token.</p>
<p><strong>With a user account, you can:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Allow or deny users permission to sign in to a computer based on their user account identity. 14：54</li>
<li>Grant users access to processes and services for a specific security context.</li>
<li>Manage users’ access to resources such as properties, shared folders, files, directories, and printer queues.</li>
</ul>
