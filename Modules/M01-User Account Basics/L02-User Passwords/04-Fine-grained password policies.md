<p>﻿## Fine-grained password policies</p>
<p><img src="....\Linked_Image_Files\1.2.4.png" alt="Screenshot of the Create Password Settings wizard. The password policy and account lockout settings are shown. " /></p>
<p>You can use fine-grained password policies to specify multiple password policies, and to apply different password restrictions and account lockout policies to different sets of users in a single domain. For example, Administrators may have different password requirements that are stricter than the policies for a user. If you cannot meet your organization’s security requirements with a single password policy, you should use fine-grained password policies.</p>
