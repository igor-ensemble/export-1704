<p>﻿## User password policies</p>
<p><img src="../..\Linked_Image_Files\1.2.1.png" alt="Visual representation of the three ways to secure your user accounts: Password Policies, Account Lockout Policies, and Fine-grained Password Policies. " /></p>
<p>In any authentication-based network, it's important to secure account credentials such as user names and passwords. In this topic, we will cover three ways to protect user account information.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Password Policies.</strong> Enable you to configure multiple requirements, such as password age, length, and complexity.</li>
<li><strong>Account Lockout Policies.</strong> Enable you to configure when to lock an account when the wrong password is entered too many times.</li>
<li><strong>Fine-grained Password Policies.</strong> Let you specify different password policies and account lockout policies for different groups of users. For example, executives, administrators, service accounts, or regular users.
