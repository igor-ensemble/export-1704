<li>You will only have <strong>four hours</strong> in the practical environment.</li>
<li>The time is cumulative, so you can work a little bit at a time until it adds up the total time allowed.</li>
<li>You may not have enough time to complete all the practical exercises. So, choose wisely. You may want to consider all the hand-on exercises and decide which ones you want to make sure you work on first.</li>
